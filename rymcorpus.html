<p>While I can recognise the atmospheric qualities of this project and why people would like it, I really struggled to engage with it. I'm usually a fan of this type of music, but I found this to be too abrupt, disjointed, and overall just not all that engaging sadly.</p></div>

      <div class="body"><p>Although I'm a big ambient enthusiast I must admit that I've always found Tim Hecker's music to be a bit of a struggle. I've certainly enjoyed some of his releases (like 2003's "Radio Amor" &amp; 2006's "Harmony In Ultraviolet") however he's never really captured me in a way that I would expect one of the undoubted leaders of the ambient/drone genre to be capable of. He seems to hover somewhere between chaotic beauty &amp; unstructured distortion &amp; I've always felt he was closer to the latter a lot of the time. His 2011 album "Ravedeath, 1972" was a prime example of this &amp; I feel similarly about "Virgins" to be honest.  </p>
<p>Although there is a little less of his signature distortion &amp; a bit more use of real instrumentation this time I find that much of the material still doesn't sound musical enough for my taste &amp; therefore I find it a chore to listen to. There's some beautiful sounds but they seem to be bouncing around randomly &amp; I really find it difficult to grab on to anything. It's the randomness &amp; the lack of any real balance that I find distracting &amp; it prevents me from ever really being able to comfortably enjoy the beauty &amp; atmospherics within this music. Many of the tracks sound like a very promising ambient CD that is badly scratched &amp; repeatedly skipping but then out of nowhere comes a track of the quality of "Stigmata II" where all of the elements of his sound fit together nicely. I don't think I'll ever fully understand Tim's music but I'll inevitably keep trying.</p></div>

      <div class="body"><p>Around the World in 581 Genres - Electroacoustic (58/581)</p>
<p>A <strong>Electroacoustic</strong> record released in the 2010s.  </p>
<p>Genre: <strong>Electroacoustic</strong> is a subgenre of <strong>Electronic Music</strong> that originated around the <strong>middle of the 20th century</strong>, following the incorporation of electronic sound production into formal compositional practice. The genre mainly revolves around the <strong>manipulation and processing of sound sources</strong> to create <strong>atmospheric pieces</strong>. There is <strong>no clear rhythm, key or live instrumentation</strong>. Instead it consists only of <strong>droning electronic sounds</strong>.  </p>
<p>Feel: <strong>Mysterious</strong>, <strong>dissonant</strong>, <strong>atmospheric</strong>. It sounds like I would imagine the cosmos to sound like — <strong>unpredictable</strong>, <strong>dark</strong> and <strong>scary</strong>.  </p>
<p>To be clear, I only listened to the piece "Rosonic". The whole album is about 14 hours long, so... yeah no.  </p>
<p>I've listened to a similar piece of music before from <a href="https://rateyourmusic.com/artist/ιαννης-ξενακης" title="[Artist3441]">Ιάννης Ξενάκης [Iannis Xenakis]</a>. It was horrible. This one was a bit more bearable but I still do not see the appeal behind it at all. Why would you make something like this? And why would you listen to this?  </p>

<p>This is great backgroud noise for studying or meditation, but as music itself, it doesn't do much for me. I enjoyed some of the nuance and variety in the first part, but the rest was mostly just sustained noise that sometimes changes a bit. I am still a rookie to drone, so perhaps I will be able to see the beauty of this record in time, after listening to "bad" drone albums, but as of right now, meh.</p>

<p>Tektra is an everlasting always sprawling record with droning sounds of lush ambiance, aquatic and spacey sounding noises, paired with what ultimately ends up to become a desolate wasteland with mo rhythm or rhyme, just chaos and burning. Though the concept of Tektra and the sounds that follow are interesting, I believe it was WAY too long. I was following until Khyra, and then everything just kind of started blending.

      <div class="body"><p>Those new to avant garde music, be warned: people will try to make you feel ignorant or uncultured for not liking Xenakis. They may even dress it up with sympathy and "you'll come to it in time" sentiment. And you won't question it because the last thing you want to look is gullible.  </p>
<p>Iannis Xenakis made some excellent music in his time. But this isn't it. It isn't too primitive for modern ears to enjoy, it isn't making the best of the technology available. It's just long, drawn out, depressing grey noise.  </p>
<p>If you want to listen to early noise experiments, seek out Edgard Varese or even journo's favourite Luigi Russolo. If you want to listen to early electronic music, try the Williams Mix, or Luciano Berio's tape experiments, or if you're feeling a little braver the likes of Stockhausen. And if you want to listen to Xenakis, his orchestral work is more interesting and more listenable.  </p>
<p>I'm not a total hater, and I can appreciate that some work probably went into tracks like "Bohor", but really, the result is something that makes electronic music seem like a really bad idea. It takes the infinite possibilities offered by tape manipulation, sound processing and the general removal of identifiable sources from sound-as-sound, and makes them all sound pointless.  </p>
<p>Fans of Stephen O'Malley will probably love it though.</p></div>

      <div class="meta">Release: Nicolas Jaar - Archivos de Radio Piedras | Year: 2024 | Vote: none</div>
      <div class="body"><p>A este punto he esperado durante meses en esta página que alguien se manifieste de manera contraria, que surja una sospecha con respecto a la narrativa que Jaar decide enebrar o bien, que alguien dispute el modo en que está articulado el imaginario del disco. No va a ocurrir. El público neófito, gringo, no sólo aplaude la pirueta de este chileno a medias, sino que la protege. No estoy reclamando autenticidad, esto no es chovinismo, pero sí me gustaría revocar la necesidad aparente en hacer numeritos como este: de hablar de alguna cosa. Por decir algo. En la realidad chilena del 2024, la articulación de mensajes políticos en el arte (de otra forma, la insistencia en un <em>arte politizado</em>) no sólo es algo que está aceptado, sino que es lo esperable y es largamente celebrado. Aún cuando es una navaja que ha perdido todo su filo, sigue latente en grupos progresistas y de izquierda, quienes muchas veces sólo intentan limpiar su propia moral en el apoyo y colaboración con estos proyectos. Es decir, un trabajo como este tiene todas las posibilidades de funcionar y de ser aplaudido, porque sigue en vigencia que la utilidad del arte reside en su tópico.</p>
<p>Sí, los grupos reaccionarios y dominantes no están escuchando esto, sino haciendo la barbarie. Pero hay aún algo que representar: una derrota, una pérdida o el sufrimiento de la gente. Abran paso, pues Jaar tiene una historia que contar. Recientemente en el Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes se han vivido grandes retrospectivas (entre ellas, a Alfredo Jaar) que están bosquejadas desde una pluma historicista que reubica y comprime las obras de arte, las circunstancias contextuales de los artistas, a una mera ecuación de escenario político más mensaje. Ahí se genera el sentido: en la aparente crisis, en la supuesta tensión, en el "naufragio" advenido. Veo una analogía. De este modo, hay que empezar a comentar y criticar firmemente las tendencias curatoriales, pero también la propia astucia de los artistas de vender gato por liebre, es decir, de preveer a un público que necesita hacer del arte un espejo donde ver su pobre realidad injusta. Y de suponer que el arte puede hacer algo como esto, es meramente generar una impresión ideológica en el espectador. Un acto de ilusionismo.</p>
<p>A día de hoy, hay muchas formas de generar este diagrama: género, raza, internet, desigualdad, medialidad, tecnología, clases sociales o diversidad sexual. Hay otros que, como beatos y por lo contrario, creen en la santísima pureza de las formas en sí mismas. Hay algunos que se la juegan haciendo un trabajo mixto, hay otros que envejecen ladrando la misma mierda de siempre, pero para un artista como Nicolás Jaar, ha sido de gran utilidad la epopeya política. Sin embargo, me detiene aquí la curiosidad. Si estos trabajos detalan la urgencia de los contextos (o de una dimensión múltiple en la worldwide web), ¿cuál es el contexto en el que vive Nicolás Jaar y que salpica a este disco? El contexto del mundo: ¿la victoria de la hegemonía sobre el subdesarrollo? ¿Será del artista foráneo que va de vacaciones con un basto patrimonio bajo el brazo y que fetichiza su entorno? ¿Del artista comprometido que va a relacionarse a las periferias y a hacer valer su responsabilidad artística? En su visión, ¿habrá exoticidad, autenticidad, ingenuidad o un notable vigor? Es algo muy difícil de recomponer. ¿Y cómo afectaría el criterio de recepción de Radio Piedras? No lo sé. La verdad es que en la era que nos compete, los artistas pueden rearmar sus propias (o ajenas) vivencias con la finalidad de ejecutar un sentido lateral que guíe y custodie las obras. En la mayoría de los casos, el espectador pierde mediante su pasividad y cae en la narrativa como si se tratase de una telaraña.</p>
<p>En 1987, Enrique Lihn denominó a Roberto Matta "chileno sin nacionalidad". En un ensayo vívido, de gran fuerza crítica, remite a su carácter burgués, su aspecto cosmopolita, su lejanía pavimentada por su casta familiar —habrá que investigar los apellidos Matta-Echaurren, respectivamente— y tras ello, se detiene en un dato interesante. Matta vuelve a fijarse, espontáneamente, en Chile tras el intento de Allende del socialismo a la chilena. Lo que impregna su vuelta tras pasearse durante años por Estados Unidos y Europa, es la contingencia y convulsión política. De situarse opositor, al margen, contrariado, de denuncia a la injusticia imperialista. <em>Forward</em>: Chile 2019-2020. Hay algo de esta situación que me remite fuertemente a Jaar, ¿será que la crisis del mundo seguirá generando este capital artístico explotable para artistas millonarios, descontextualizados, condescendientes y populistas? Todo parece indicar que sí. Y es que Jaar tiene enbobada a la multitud en Chile, un público fehaciente, acrítico, consumidor, que suspira en cada ocasión esperando un desafío, una novedad. La nueva pirueta del gran artista mundial.</p>
<p>Sobre la música, suponiendo que esta es una reseña sobre un fonograma, este trabajo presenta las últimas tendencias ("experimentos") de Jaar impregnados de localismos. Primero, escuchar su tono de impostura cuando habla como chileno es vergonzoso. Las partes habladas (con gran teatralidad, evocación, sentimentalismo) muchas veces se cruzan con texturas ("inquietantes", "extrañas", producto del último diseño sonoro del mercado) y ambientes (como gustan hoy en día: profundos, inmersivos, avasalladores) que generan una disposición atmosférica y escénica para trazar el relato. Un poco apabullante, la verdad. Pero esta gran masa grandilocuente de sonidos y canciones descompuestas no es un problema. Por otro lado, en un contexto de un disco experimental, sí es un problema el propio conservadurismo de los recursos, el tratamiento tradicionalista de la narración y la incapacidad de desligarse de sus propios lenguajes o lugares comunes.</p>
<p>No sé muy bien cómo terminar. En agosto pasado, en un intento frustrado por comentar todo lo anterior, escribí: "La actualidad del mundo es para Jaar una cuestión matérica o un juguete desarmable". Y pese que estas palabras (toda esta reseña) sostienen una cólera personal, sumamente subjetiva, creo que es asfixiante la situación en que este trabajo esté siendo denominado por algunos usuarios "monumental achievement" o dicho sobre él: "no piece of art has so wholly encapsulated this historical moment" eludiendo su propio contexto de producción histórica, la operatividad y funcionalidad de su marco simbólico y a la larga, su propio egoísmo burgués. Todavía faltan las palabras y cojeo cuando escribo esto. Pero no se pierdan, Nicolás Jaar no ha necesitado jamás lanzar una piedra y no hay ningún problema con esto. Y pese a que pueda seguir elaborando, dando más de estos palos ciegos, prefiero cerrar con una cita (que he repetido mil veces) de Pierre Bourdieu: "La enajenación cultural excluye la conciencia de la enajenación. Porque la dominación fundada en el capital cultural es mucho más estable, mucho mas fuerte que una dominación fundada solamente en el capital económico". Creo que la recepción de este trabajo y su circulación puede dar una beta de ello.</p></div>

In general, the spoken word is more heavily weighted to the front of the album, and the more transcendent stuff is towards the end of the album.

<p>Well that was unnecessary. It's just drone. Sometimes it feels like it sounds nice, even powerful, sure. I would like to go with the flow and hype the music, but there's not much to grasp. If you simply like any drone, ambient, that's not too embarrassing sounding, I can recommend this album. It's darkish. Otherwise, do not trust art ambassadors. If you made the mistake of listening to this, and didn't like it; if you like complexity instead of nicely nocturnal sounding constant drone background music, check out some albums I've rated better, I promise I will not fool you by supporting acts like this.

<p>Połączenie glitchu z zakłóceniami radiowego odbiornika na <em><a href="https://rateyourmusic.com/release/album/tim-hecker/radio-amor/" title="[Album53577]">Radio Amor</a></em> czy kościelne, organowe echo rozchodzące się po <em><a href="https://rateyourmusic.com/release/album/tim-hecker/ravedeath-1972/" title="[Album3208874]">Ravedeath, 1972</a></em> to dla mnie kluczowe momenty muzyczne, definiujące nie tylko charakter samego ambientu, ale także całej sceny alternatywnej XXI wieku. Dlatego <a href="https://rateyourmusic.com/artist/tim-hecker" title="[Artist14863]">Tim Hecker</a> zawsze będzie dla mnie artystą ważnym – tym, który wraz z innymi przedstawicielami glitch-ambientu takimi jak <a href="https://rateyourmusic.com/artist/fennesz" title="[Artist4780]">Christian Fennesz</a> czy <a href="https://rateyourmusic.com/artist/oval" title="[Artist3528]">Oval</a>, wykradł ideę muzycznej relaksacji legendom gatunku i oddał ją światu w formie paradoksalnej, zderzającej subtelną melodyjność z falami ciepłego, spowijającego noise’u.  </p>
<p><em><a href="https://rateyourmusic.com/release/album/tim-hecker/no-highs/" title="[Album15113024]">No Highs</a></em> jest porzuceniem owego, urokliwego paradoksu na rzecz bezpiecznej kalkulacji. Nie ma tu radykalizmu lub ryzyka w żadnym wymiarze – budowane przez Kanadyjczyka tekstury obfitują za to w tanie zabiegi emocjonalne. Zwiększająca się do skrajnych poziomów głośność syntezatorowych padów na <em>Monotony</em> próbuje wymusić emocje bez ambicji ich naturalnego wywołania. Upiorne, rozproszone syntezatory na <em>Glissalia</em> tworzą natomiast immersyjną atmosferę i bańkę dźwięków, z której nie następuje żadna ewolucja poza wytworzoną przez nią strefę komfortu. Nawet ciekawsze kompozycje – takie jak burzliwe, opatrzone smyczkami <em>In Your Mind</em> – padają ofiarą ogólnego problemu albumu, jakim jest długość utworów, połączona z brakiem spoiwa między nimi. Nie ma tu bowiem, klasycznych dla <em>Heckera</em>, płynnych przejść do kolejnych kompozycji oraz kontynuowania w nich motywów wprowadzonych wcześniej. Najbardziej tracą na tym, dominujące na trackliście, utwory krótkie (aż 6 utworów poniżej 3 minut) – nie dają sobie one czasu na wytworzenie w nich ciekawej progresji, lub wprowadzenie słuchacza w medytację.</p>
<p>Jeden z bardziej intrygujących zabiegów stanowią natarczywie repetytywne klawisze na <em>Monotony I/II, Lotus Light</em> i <em>Anxiety</em>, stanowiące analogię do wczesnego minimalizmu (<em><a href="https://rateyourmusic.com/release/album/terry-riley/in-c/" title="[Album28514]">In C</a></em> <a href="https://rateyourmusic.com/artist/terry-riley" title="[Artist8109]">Terrego Rileya</a>). Przeistaczają się one w trakcie trwania utworów w bogate tło dla reszty stopniowo inkorporowanego instrumentarium. Pozytywnie zaskakuje też organiczność wydawnictwa – Kanadyjczyk zgrabnie łączy smyczki i instrumenty dęte z otaczającą je elektroniką. Najlepszym tego przykładem jest opatrzone frywolną saksofonową solówką <a href="https://rateyourmusic.com/artist/colin-stetson" title="[Artist120435]">Colina Stetsona</a> <em>Monotony II</em>, które po stworzeniu niepowtarzalnej tekstury niestety zmierza donikąd. Podobnych momentów stawiających słuchacza gdzieś pomiędzy harmonijnym ukojeniem, a strukturalnym niedosytem jest tu zdecydowanie zbyt wiele. Chciałoby się lepiej zapoznać ze szczegółową fakturalnością utworów – <em>Hecker</em> niestety utrudnia to znacząco brakiem, charakteryzującej go niegdyś, kompozytorskiej wyobraźni.  </p>
<p>Mglisty – to nie tylko przymiotnik określający sam teksturalny charakter tej muzyki, ale także jej artystyczne walory. Zgodnie z tytułem, brak tu wzlotów, które wynosiłyby album na poziom ponadprzeciętny. Nie wyobrażam sobie aby w mojej świadomości zagościł on jako cokolwiek ponad miły w odbiorze, lecz bezpieczny i niezwykle zamglony blok dźwięku.</p></div>

After 5 straight listens to this album I am still stuck on the same question why and how this resembles any modern classical music. If I ever do rate him the chances are that in 2/3 years time I would feel rather embarrassed of my own self in rating/judging him. From what little I have seen of this man in various videos, his music is also a medium of his own research on the science of sound and the perception that people have towards them, it simply goes beyond the gentle and sweet sounding EITS, that the critics tend to favor, or even the ragefull and rebellious Perl Jam, which the radio sells and makes you believe is quality music.  </p>
<p>But despite that one should listen to such music, with this at least one will question the very basic question of nature of music, its norms and boundaries or what has been told to us about music that we know now. And remember this was all back in 1956 !</p></div>

<p>Experimental music is hard. As is in the name, it breaks convents and pushes the boundaries of what is possible with music. With that, I often project my feelings towards experimental music differently than I would for more traditional styles of music. Instead of solely focusing on melodies, song structures, techniques, etc, I’ll focus more on the pure emotion and energy of the tracks. Although, importantly, the musical elements of the music must still be present, with the only exception being music that pushes an idea so far that it can only be judged outside of the context of music. (See my Starving Sluts review).  </p>
<p>So, what makes this album so different? Why can you clearly see my negative rating and hear me chant the pretentious take of “well what does it mean to make music ANYWAYS?!?!” Well, for one, the builds are not worth the wait at all. In fact it’d be a stretch to even call the haunting samples here builds. Just electroacoustic noises with german spoken words. This makes each track feel unresolved, with every minute that passes turning into an hour. It makes for an interesting art piece, but even good art is conclusive. Even art that leaves you feeling empty still has something resolved by the end, musically or narratively, or that feeling of emptiness follows beyond the end of the album. The none endings don’t feel grand or powerful here, just boring. Like fourty minutes of my life were wasted in the pursuit of something greater. Something thst never came.  </p>
<p>Although the feelings of anxiety are present, nothing here is at all strong enough to give it the push it needs. Maybe make the ending of the tracks more layered or something. This album is definitely impressive, but nothing more.</p>

I've had lots of experiences with extreme avant-garde music and it all sounds great in theory, but this album offers no pleasure or stimulation for me in actual practice, while there are endless thousands of other challenging and odd albums I actually enjoy.

Unfortunately, it keeps going for another 30 minutes and is dragged down by extensive passages of involuntary vocalizations that simply do not do it for me without some kind of melodic counterpoint. It starts getting dull around the 20 minute mark and never quite captures my attention at that early level again.  </p>
<p>Brave concept and occasionally very beautiful, but a torturous 45 minutes for me. I recommend giving it a try, but be aware of what you're in for and prepare accordingly. This is not music to listen to walking around town with earbuds in. Find a quiet space in your home and soak it in.</p></div>

      <div class="body"><p>Blemish is the 10th ( with and without various collaborators) full-length studio album by UK progressive/ experimental pop/ rock artist David Sylvian.  </p>
<p>The music on the album is experiemental and ambient pop/ rock with David Sylvian´s emotional and warm vocal delivery as the focal point. The songs are very ambient in nature and features electronic sounds and a great deal of atonal and experimental guitar playing. While the experiment in itself is interesting I can´t say that I´m too thrilled about the outcome. David Sylvian´s vocal lines are seldom supported by anything harmonic, which generally make the songs very monotone sounding. Blemish is a very introvert album and while that concept can work wonders sometimes, I think Blemish fails in engaging the listener for very long. The vocals and the rest of the music seem like they were recorded independently and then brougth together.  </p>
<p>The production is warm and professional.  </p>
<p>Blemish is quite a disappointment for me. I have a hard time enjoying the album and while I greatly respect David Sylvian´s experimental approach to writing pop/ rock, this is too "different" for my taste. I enjoy his music more when it´s more harmonic and melodic. I can´t give more than a 2 star rating.  </p>

      <div class="body"><p>I don't know ambient music, so if you're looking for a proper, well-thought out review, keep looking.  </p>
<p>Admittedly, Konoyo might be my first real foray into ambient music and it's not a style that I'm particularly attracted to, so the results of listening to it were kind of predictable - I don't get it, it's boring to me. But I'll try to find other things to talk about with it. The first thing that comes to mind is that it's kind of the opposite of what I expected it to be in terms of how it would come across. By that, I mean it's not the relaxing, easy to ignore background sound that i was expecting - Konoyo makes it hard to concentrate on much else with it's somewhat mechanical, grating sound. At least the album begins that way before melting into something a little different, but it's a little hard to get into because of that. As the album progresses, it settles in or maybe you just become more accustomed to it.  </p>
<p>I welcome any of the times that the music becomes more, well, musical. There's an almost Godspeed You! Black Emperor vibe to this where at times you feel like Tim Hecker isn't actually making the music, it's just happening somewhere and he's recording it. It's not as foreboding or nearly as atmospheric, which is really important, but the feeling is there. I also find it to be industrial in a sense - kind of a warehouse full of people using equipment sort of things. It's actually kind of a nice mix which makes it slowly turn into something that I could see myself listening to if I was desperate for background noise.  </p>
<p>I doubt I ever will, though.</p></div>

      <div class="body"><p>I have finally come to terms with the fact that this album is really annoying and probably my least favorite thing that Tim Hecker has ever done. Given that a lot of his more recent work had started to feel a little boring and predictable, I can appreciate the need to change things up and reinvent, but I'm honestly at a loss as why this was received so positively. I find it genuinely grating, and I enjoy - or have enjoyed - my fair share of drone, noise, and ambient records.  </p>
<p>As interesting as the process and concepts behind it may be, I don't find the end result to be moving or evocative other than to just feel tonally unpleasant and tediously drawn out. It feels compressed and shallow as if all there is hear is right there on the surface - one big, dull monolith. Nothing more reveals itself, and what's there quickly wears out its welcome. The more I listen to it, the more I actively dislike it.</p></div>

<p>It's cool. He says a couple sentences, takes a recording, plays it into a room, and records that recording. The recording gradually warps, and at the end, isn't more than a series of ethereal drones. It's a very interesting experiment, but not really anything more. Contrary to what the speaker says, this is essentially a demonstration. Think of it as an art piece, it's kinda pretentious, a little boring, but ultimately very creative and interesting. In the modern age, there are plenty of better drone pieces meant for casual listening, but this stands as a very cool artistic piece exploring change and resonance. The original release with two tracks may be better, as you can skip all the earlier stages if you just wanna zone out to some cool sounds, but I'm sure you could find better, more layered and intricate drone out there.</p></div>

Tracks 1,3, 8,9, and 11 are very bad and all apply to the initial review. There doesn't seem to be much purpose in any of the songs. The addition of classical music instrumentation on top of electronics does not mean the songs are good - Side A Why were these songs written?  </p>
<p>Track #2 "Lament" is rather good and by far and away the best track - 4.0 star. Why couldn't more songs be as captivating as this track? It really holds our interest and is very beautiful sounding. Tracks 4,5,6,7 and 10 are average tracks and what we should expect for ambient/classical music. They all have a sense of purpose although there is nothing special about them - Side B<br />
Total rating average 1.75 stars.  </p>
<p>Since half the album is unlistenable for me and thes songs are really leaving a lasting impression in my mind, I will have to round the rating to 1.5 stars.  </p>

      <div class="body"><p>With a decade-long career on his back, modern-day <a href="https://rateyourmusic.com/genre/musique-concrete/" title="[Genre10084]">Musique concrète</a> practitioner Jason Lescalleet released the ambitious 2CD monolith "Songs About Nothing".  </p>
<p>CD1 acts as a sampler of abstract <a href="https://rateyourmusic.com/genre/noise/" title="[Genre342]">Noise</a> tapestries, from the high-pitch frequency of "The Beauty Of Independent Music", to the intoxicated <a href="https://rateyourmusic.com/genre/drone/" title="[Genre246]">Drone</a>-<a href="https://rateyourmusic.com/genre/electro/" title="[Genre319]">Electro</a> thump of "Old Theme", the sub-hissing and gearing of "Tarnished Copper", the beat collage of "The Loop", the distortions and gurgling electronics of "Euphoric Sting", the mirage of echoes and cosmic float of "Beauty Is A Bowtie", the static tone of "The Power Of Pussy", the out-of-focus <a href="https://rateyourmusic.com/genre/ambient/" title="[Genre84]">Ambient</a> expressionism of "In The Morning", the allusive crackling of "10 Amp Waves" etc.  </p>
<p>CD2 offers the 43-minute behemoth "The Future Belongs To No One", which explores the same ideas in a more heroic setting, one that has a lot in common with the kosmische music of the 70's, while the closure experiments with microscopic ambient and experimental theatre, before the track ends bizarrely with a slow-motion snippet of <a href="https://rateyourmusic.com/artist/depeche-mode" title="[Artist181]">Depeche Mode</a>'s "It's No Good" (eh?!).  </p>
<p>Overall, the first CD is unnecessary. He gets to the point in the second CD, which is not particularly enthralling either, but it has it's moments.</p></div>

      <div class="body"><p>[Oct 10, 2012]  </p>
<p>It isn't often one hears about highly-anticipated releases in more avant-garde genres (even if it's Merzbow or something) but I decided to look into Jason Lescalleet after hearing a bit of hype for <em>Songs About Nothing</em>. Even after a few listens of this album, I'm still a bit perplexed—it's mostly enjoyable, but it's hard to say why.  </p>
<p>The album's first disc ia a challenging one for me and I'm really not sure how to approach it. While I'm almost always one to fully dive into noise and sound collage sorts of albums, this one is very difficult to penetrate. Each individual track is so different in sound that it's hard to get a grip on what I'm listening to. On the first disc, the short tracks jump around crazily—pure noise, EAI, crackly glitch, drone, dark ambient, and of course the Big Black samples dance in and out of the picture. On one hand, the pieces themselves are pretty neat and Lescalleet crafts a lot of pleasing textures; on the other hand, I feel like each one of these pieces (the good ones, anyway) really deserve to be more fleshed-out. What we get are thirteen bite-sized bits of musique concrète but most of the album deserves better than that.  </p>
<p>However the more quiet and introspective tracks (mainly "Escargot" through "Friday Night in a Catholic Home") really grabbed me—the softer ambience, subtle background sounds, warm drones: that was the point where I really started to get into the album. It's simply a shame that, again, they were so short.</p>
<p>The second disc, a forty-three minute long soundscape, is (to me) a bit more typical of the minimal noise / drone I usually listen to—eerie drones, pulsing ominous synths, deep dark bass frequencies, and some interesting processed sampling. It slowly evolves into some abstract microsound / ambient / field recordings akin to the tracks I mentioned on the first disc; it's pleasing stuff (though there's not much to say about it).  </p>
<p>I think Lescalleet handles the long-form album much better, as "The Future Belongs to No One" is much easier for me to get into and appreciate, one of those pieces that it's too easy to get lost in. It doesn't pound the listener with harsh changes or out-of-place samples (except for the last few minutes—but let's just pretend like that part never happened).  </p>
<p>Again, I'm still not really sure what to take from <em>Songs About Nothing</em>—is it ahead of its time, that we're seeing this sort of avant-garde music made into a more accessible and listener-friendly format? Or is it just a self-indulgent exercise in sound composition? Or neither? I don't know. Taken at face value, as a simple album on its own, it's okay. It has its highs and lows, like any other release, and for me that's all it is.</p></div>

<p>But, I found the overall album to be either tedious or irritating (especially the portions with the child babbling away). Furthermore, much of this could easily be relegated to the overwhelmingly pretentious bin.  </p>
<p>Not for nothing, why are so many musical offerings labeled "experimental", "intellectual" or "artistic" so devoid of melody and rhythm? It's not like I don't like to be challenged, but this was just a one-sided beat-down.</p></div>

I probably am cause I'm too lazy to get Chrome on every computer I use, but right now I hate firefox because it crashed and didn't save my review, and didn't ask me if I wished to open new fucking firefox or the last one that was opened. Neither did RYM auto-save my review. It's lost... Well, here I go again.  </p>
<p>So the album of the year has being started again this year. Last year, this ambitious proposal which seeks to get the whole community together to exchange and comment albums could not be completed last year, when after the first weeks, not only did comment on the threads diminished, but even the album downloading. This 2010, Ezreal has decided to give it another go, and after 3 weeks, we have been to Finland, Mexico, and back across the Atlantic to France. This time, not only is the album not from the US or the UK, but it is also from a quite unfamiliar genre. One of those which dmpulp would call "only for music snobs".</p>
<p>I had never before tried listening to experimental avant garde music, nor do am I interested after listening to this, but I must admit that I was intrigued by the first listen. This was helped by the fact that the album sat on its .rar form for a week on my desktop after my inability to unzip it on a Linux computer. However, after a second trial, I just couldn't take it. It almost gave me a headache, an by the third song I was really wishing for this thing to end. What I once thought might be interested, this time I just find it like being in a foreign country which once was a French colony, and aimlessly surfing through the tv channels, with no real sequence or reason, or even understanding, I felt like I went through religious channels with prayers, to heavy metal channels with awful musical taste.  </p>
<p>I can understand if some people like this, or find it attractive, interesting, life changing, whatever. But to me, this is just aimless and even annoying. As for me, Experimental Avant Garde is better off on the shelf of music genres I'm not really interested in. Anyways, the album inspired some little nonsense of a short story, which I called "Seems like a Total Eclipse of the Sun", which you can read at <a href="http://diegoardonsblog.blogspot.com/2010/02/some-little-nonsense.html">http://diegoardonsblog.blogspot.com/2010/02/some-little-nonsense.html</a></p></div>

      <div class="body"><p>a dark drone for ten minutes... a bore for an album</p>
<p>"Emergence" beings with dark sonorities and someone moaning. Here Kirchin uses his usual device of simply slowing down something on the tape machine. It doesn't sound otherworldly or strange. It simply sounds like something slowed down on the tape machine.  </p>
<p>The next part has a string pad with some of those autistic children the composer favours. This is disturbing just for the veneer of exploitation. It veers off into B-movie horror film territory for many a long minute, before coming back to the drone. Thankfully no jazz at all!  </p>
<p>"Evolution" begins with more drones and indistinct gargling. Then an even more disturbing child than before. Some vague notes on a guitar add to the rhythm towards the end.  </p>
<p>This would have been great for ten or twelve minutes but really stretches one's patience for 36.  </p>
<p>The sound quality throughout is rubbish. If someone has the master tapes they could do the world a favour by issuing them.  </p>
<p>This is nowhere near as revolutionary (or listenable) as many would claim. The real musique concrete was far more extreme, and had been for two decades already. Nonetheless, this is much preferable to Kirchin's banal soundtracks and overly polite library music.</p></div>

      <div class="body"><p>Laundry machine house for fans of Seefeel, Arseny Aavramov’s Symphony of Factory Sirens and Arthur Honneger’s Pacific 231.  </p>
<p>I just saw Mark Leckey's "Containers and their Drivers" at P.S.1, and part of it was a Samsung Smart Fridge hooked up to a samsung sound system which played the fridge's thoughts as recorded by a Samsung Phone, which played a lil' music video on a Samsung TV. Leckey aimed to create a ~brand universe~ which was totally successful and hilarious. When I saw this, I couldn't help but be reminded of Matmos' Ultimate Care II. I felt that the album failed me. Perhaps I can try and flesh out the reason why. Both pieces of course have very different goals, but there was something so much more serene about that dang Fridge!  </p>
<p>The appliance worship trend in the art world is a peculiar thing. And it all has a very similar aesthetic, which the album art for this release certainly exhibits. There is a certain banality to it all that can't help but take center stage with an embarrassed, beat-red blush. But it is perhaps that the Laundry Machine comes out part of an appreciated anecdote for the listener to tell to their friends instead of a laughable realization of reliance and stupid branding.  </p>
<p>A sonically interesting piece nonetheless, and its fun to think of John Cage and Christian Wolff listening to this. So we finally managed to get our hands on ambient technological noise and turn THAT in to pop music too. . . hmm. . .</p></div>

      <div class="body"><p>It's a good job there's a concept here, because as abstract music it's not much. Most of the sounds a washing machine makes are not very different to the sounds you get from more conventional instruments - it rattles, thumps, buzzes. About the only distinctive thing is the rhythmic sloshing of water, which I like, but is it enough? Yet if you can hold in your head for thirty-eight minutes the thought that you're listening to a washing machine then it is pleasantly, if mildly, hallucinatory, and the banal nature of the music is unimportant and perhaps even appropriate, because washing your pants is banal, isn't it? I bet Picasso never washed his pants. I bet he waited till each pair was board-stiff then stole another bed sheet from the neighbour's washing line and fashioned a new pair. I expect he retained the services of a first-class <em>caleçonier</em>, but when he went to pick up his order he paid by drawing pictures of bulls on them all, meaning he left with exactly the same number of pants as he had arrived with (i.e., no pants). I don't really know how to weigh the importance of music in the abstract against any concept it carries, the sound-as-such against its attendant baggage; do we want art to say what it means or are we happy for things to be hidden there, I don't know, I never have. Hang on though, lets dwell on this a moment.</p>
<p><strong>Pants of the Great Artists</strong>  </p>
<p>El Greco - Always the wrong size  </p>
<p>Gainsborough - Primark, usually red  </p>
<p>Ingres - Entirely covered himself in underwear, literally could not see him  </p>
<p>Bonnard - Changed his pants (half white, half lemon) after every meal  </p>
<p>Soutine - Pants constantly falling down, held them up with one hand  </p>
<p>Grünewald - Did not own pants, tied a saucepan lid over his genitals with string  </p>
<p>Having given it thought, this record's okay.</p></div>

<p>There are dozens of modern and contemporary composers who are at least as bombastic as Dolden, and who dare to be cynical about being bombastic in music-making, and whose aesthetics, either through self-deprecation or programmatic nihilism, or both, reaches or sketches less predictable soundscapes, managing to entertain even when, occasionally, working deliberately not to.  </p>
<p>Incidentally, if I had to pinpoint the same failures regarding the same attempts, and keeping the bombastic component at the limelight, however outside the so-called electrocoustic niche, I would take <a href="https://rateyourmusic.com/release/album/the-calder-quartet/transfiguration/" title="[Album2715790]">Transfiguration</a>, by <a href="https://rateyourmusic.com/artist/christopher-rouse" title="[Artist92624]">Christopher Rouse</a>, who operates at the modern classical genre.  </p>

If every track was as powerful, concise, and provocative as Angel Investor and The Courtesan Jigokadayu Sees Herself As a Skeleton in the Mirror of Hell, then that would be an entirely different story because this one-two punch to close the album up is phenomenal.

      <div class="body"><p>My mum is drunk on her sofa and she asks ‘what’s that noise’ and it’s the type of music that is hard to tell if it’s in too loud and it made me think of flies and it made me think of elephant trunks and sometimes it made me think of angels and it also made me think of my mums windchimes and my mum yawned and started stamping her feet. There is a cat next to me. The music sounds familiar, it’s pretty nice and I like it when it pushes the sounds to a point where they teeter on being discordant. The cat moved along. My mum talks about the pictures that have been fading through as the tv screensaver. Warm building with twirly twizzle noise and that near metal vibrate sound. My mum asked me to turn it down believing the music to be upsetting her cats. “There is no doubt about it, they are beautiful cats” she said and I thought about how I’d likely give this a higher score if I was listening to it on headphones and not in the living room through a speaker with my mum. I dunno though, sometimes it is meditation class sometimes it is avant garde slow paced puppet show score. I sometimes find it hard to hear identity in ambient music and I found that with opener ‘In My Room’. Maybe it is because I do not have a room to call my own. Making it all about me again. Hissy hissy. Song ended in a more interesting way with a distant wibble wobblo maybe in a cheap keyboard.</p>
<p>My mum has left and I decide to roll a spliff and now I am listening to ‘Rainfall’. I am already less interested in listening to this album without the company of my mother and was pleased when she returned in the room with cheese on crackers. All film weeuuurrggghhhh maybe like with bows on cymbals or something. It irrrrrssss a lot and I don’t think I like it even though I’d probably listen to it every day if I’d recorded it. I think this one maybe has more power in it than the previous track. It’s stressful and I imagine someone having a bad time. Some tone comes in and thunder crack and oh I guess this is the rain. If I could use emojis in reviews I would have used a raincloud emoji there. Some kind of electrical big boss as the strings ungulate. “Did you enjoy that” my mum asked about the cheese and biscuits. I said yes and I asked her if she liked the music and she ignored me and started telling the cat ‘Geezer’ how much she loves him and how much her loves her. There is some percussive movement, or at least I hear some pace but I’m not sure I’m too sold on it. I repeat my question and my mum says “it’s ok, it’s just getting to me, bit loud” and I turn it down again. As the song progressed i liked it less and less, sounding like a euphoric break bit in a Di set that never goes anywhere and just gets lost in effects pedals. “Do you think if you jumped from a space station into the ocean you’d survive”, she then started talking about how appetising that sounded and the music became more string focused but it sounded like an old recording, then it got more wibbly again like the end of the first track did but I had less patience for it this time round. I was kinda interested in the scrappy noise over the top and it confused me a lot.</p>
<p>‘Agora’ was chilly and I zoned it quickly and my mum fell asleep and I forgot it was on and became more absorbed in the other sounds going on in my parents house and outside which I guess isn’t a good sign. I zoned out again. I guess this song is good to zone out to. I don’t know what I enjoyed about it though. I find it hard to concentrate on. ‘We Trigger The Sun’ has a bit more going on to pay attention to and I thought of a big flat worm growing wider and I liked the crunchy noises and some of it sounded a bit alien and a bit x files but not in a fun way, this sounds like it could be the music for the queueing area for a Sci-fi ride at a theme park that wants to be engaging to the bored queueing people but also maintain an ominous tone. It’s definitely more emotive and I enjoyed this track more than the previous two. As a whole the album didn’t so much to stand out for me. The opener and closer where the strongest parts but every time I lost myself it felt like it was in spite of the music not because of it. I occasionally thought of big sludge bubbles popping and those where the best bits.  </p>

      <div class="body"><p>Music has one fascinating power: the capacity to give pleasure. Sometimes the intellectual side try to rival this predisposition, and other times sentimentality comes to baffle everything. The worst thing I could say about a record (nevermind what genre) is something like this cruel sentence: its worth to the world is nothing! Or simply: This is BOREDOM.<br />
Brian Eno recorded a handful of visionary and delightful albums using the reworking of his own tapes and previous sessions; with meticulous hands he gave to the world a work filled by pleasure and emotions, although surrounded with intellectual premisses. The Mnemonists took the same premiss on rebuilding their creation but with nefast consequences. Nothing lives here, dissonance and noise are only ostentations, I mean could pretentiousness sometimes comes by avoiding gongorism? This boredom has very little to do with Biota's eeriness.</p></div>

      <div class="body"><p>This new record from the longstanding experimental pop artist sees a somewhat drastic shift in ideas and aesthetics where instead of more lush and bouncy pop music we are getting a minimal, grand, and somewhat haunting ambient electroacoustic record. There are vocal passages here and there that do have a more ambient pop aesthetic, but for the most part, this is a long and winding ambient record in which we are given various different sonic textures and styles. The album starts more hypnotic and light and as the record progresses the more spastic and dark it gets. Although the album is interesting the overall length of the project can be too much for the somewhat bland ideas presented, plus the singing can really distract you from the rest of the pieces when it is there.</p></div>

      <div class="body"><p>It Can Be Too Gentle</p>
<p>Filled with ambiance and glitches, Cash's "Heal Process" is a gentle breeze in the ears of the listener.  </p>
<p>Sometimes it can be too gentle, making you forget that you're listening to it. It's that kind of album that is very smooth in its sound design, and musically it can be more about holding onto one atmosphere instead of exploring new ones or making up a new melody to grab onto, this being especially clear with the song "a warm glow" and as you move on through the tracklist. This doesn't stop it from being an overall solid experience, where some songs go back to grabbing your attention, one of those being the highlight "passthrough", which its vocal chops and even deep drum rhythm really end up creating an entrancing experience, to me at least. "underneath" is also very interesting as an album closer, by again bringing drums to diversify and focus on rhythm, almost like an IDM track.  </p>
<p>In short, while it may have benefited from more variety (because even ambient music can have variety), it still manages to be a decent experience.</p></div>

      <div class="body"><p>Open things up and look inside.</p>
<p>Matmos is known as a conceptual Duo, and with their musique concrete stylings and aesthetics, they have texture to boot. In terms of electronic music, experimental music, and avant-garde music, they are one of the most essential contemporary duos out there. Normally with these found sound records the group are able to put their full heart into the project. However, on A Chance to Cut is a Chance to Cure, the pair put full bodies into it this time around. Not only that, but it seems like underneath the squelchy, surgery samples, and quirky melodies there are some pretty high concept themes going on here. In fact these themes are so high concept and abstract, that they forget to appear in the music itself. That's the biggest takeaway for me on this album. While I think the textures are neat, and the songs are fine, I don't think the record as a whole is very interesting nor do I really get its concept without really doing some surgery myself. Not only that, but it has always seemed to me that Matmos has taken great care to have a lot of consistency in the records. Here though I think the sound is a little bit all over the place. All in all I think there are two amazingly great moments on the record, and everything else is kind of fine to lackluster. It's a neat project, one that every Matmos fan should listen to, but I'm not very keen on it after 6 listens. Maybe I still need to open things up and look inside.</p></div>

      <div class="body"><p>It's a great, fun concept - I just wish they'd stuck to it more. See, it was supposed to be an album of electronic music that samples sound effects recorded from actual surgery. On the first track, "Lipostudio...And So On," for example, they take gushing and slurping sounds from liposuction operations, and meld them into an infectious techno rhythm that is a lot of fun, and just delightfully icky.  </p>
<p>Too bad that's the only track of its quality on the record - too many of these cuts are filled with noise, glitch sounds, and other anti-music that makes much of the album unlistenable. Even on the tracks that have some sort of a techno beat center, they meander far too much and nothing here is as cohesive as that first track. Particular offenders are "L.A.S.I.K." and "For Felix (And All the Rats)," which are complete noise-fests which only technically qualify as music.  </p>
<p>It's a shame, because bits and pieces of this album are really, really good - and that's why my rating isn't lower than it is. Perhaps instead of using the "surgery" gimmick as the concept for an album, they should have limited themselves to one unique track that might have fit in nicely in a different album. Too much of the music here is simply a waste of time.</p></div>

      <div class="body"><p>I made some music once. The music I made is very easy to dismiss as trash without thinking about it too much, with many similarities to other work already commonly accepted as being poor quality so the skeptical listener wouldn't even need to come up with a new argument against it. One of the most common effects present by default in every digital audio workstation is a "backwards/backmasking" effect. I think the Beatles popularized backwards effects? Anyways it is in every DAW by default and is one of the first effects a new user is likely to mess around with. Xtoyourmilkyhair contains an excessive amount of backwards noises. The music I made also contains what some might say is an excessive amount of backwards noises, but a lot less in comparison to Xtoyourmilkyhair. A lot of very annoying and terrible music also contains an excessive amount of backwards noises, and its hard to break the association. But as you can see, Xtoyourmilkyhair was greeted with acclaim by a number of writers on this website. Maybe this is a sign that there aren't too many backwards noises, but I think there are too many backwards noises, the parts without as many backwards noises are the best parts of this record.</p></div>

The cool-ness of <em>Rhizomes</em> is not lost on me. However, in the handful of focused listens I spent with it, I couldn't get much further than "cool production technique" or "interesting texture" or "good use of guest vocalist," "wow, crazy drums," "ooh I love Daveed Diggs" (you get the picture) - and that stuff is just not enough to get me to a place to say "awesome overall album." The stylistic conventions of deconstructed club and the established methods of granular synthesis get <em>Rhizomes</em> a long way; those sounds are ear-catching for sure, and seemingly bursting with audio "information" (for lack of a better word). For me they can also get a bit tiring after awhile, so a 50-minute stretch of that stuff is a fair challenge to endure, and don't get me started about the <a href="https://rateyourmusic.com/release/album/aho-ssan/rhizomes-1/" title="[Album15515732]">two-hour version</a> (yes, I downloaded that with the full intention of giving it at least 1 or 2 honest listens, and still haven't made it to 0.5 - that's to say, it's intimidating). So, yes it's an interesting release, and sometimes it's fun to listen to something merely for interest's sake, but for me to connect with it on any deeper level, it would need something more substantive (as opposed to "merely" heady) which I'm afraid it's lacking.</p></div>

<p>However, she seems to saved all her bad taste moments for the middle movement. You get unsophisticated pounding on a detuned piano, boring tappity-tap on pipes, stupid rock-like segments, even a spaghetti-western showdown. It literally sounds like she took her suckiest material and put where it would attract the least notice.  </p>

<p>Flying Sparks and Heavy Machinery  </p>
<p>This, on the other hand, is scored for percussionists and string quartet, and without the samples you really hear Gosfield's limitations. It's a bunch of completely uninteresting pounding and scraping that does indeed sound like the inside of a factory at times.  </p>

      <div class="body"><p>(50/100)</p>
<p>Me duele bastante haberme perdido "Jazz Codes" (2022), especialmente cuado "Black Encyclopedia of the Air" (2021) fue un gran proyecto.<br />
"The Great Bailout" no solo se aleja bastante de un concepto sólido y accesible, sino que inicia o abre un portal a una dimensión increíblemente compleja y que sin duda es interesante, pero también es algo tan abstracto como para aferrarse a lo que sea.</p>
<p>Este movimiento musical, porque lo es, por supuesto, simplemente abstrae la musicalidad de sí misma para dar un discurso poético que, hasta eso, tampoco considero que sea impresionante. Simplemente hay muy poco de todo como para darle una extensión o una trascendencia y su abstracción tampoco ayuda por el simple hecho de que se siente como un collage con bastantes partes vacías en el lienzo.  </p>
<p>Hasta eso, el álbum se me pasó rápido, lo cual agradezco, porque dentro de toda esta ambientación, que es lo único que considero que se logra de forma puntual, hay un espectro de sonidos que chocan entre sí, no saben muy bien como fusionarse y de repente, empalmado a todo, tenemos el discurso. Y la verdad es que no se escucha desordenado o caótico, simplemente se escucha como una habitación enorme en donde los elementos se esfuerzan por no convivir entre ellos, pero se permiten explorar su propio espacio.  </p>
<p>Entre otras varias interpretaciones que le puedo dar a este proyecto, simplemente me gustaría regresar a escuchar a Moor Mother en un concepto más trascendental e inspirador como el que ha trabajado antes. Y si bien no estoy diciendo que renuncie completamente a cualquiera de sus intenciones, creo que me gustaría escuchar esto en un movimiento musical más conciso. Por ahora, no lo recomiendo, especialmente si es un primer acercamiento a esta gran artista, pero para ser parte de su identidad musical se aprecia su propia libertad y forma de expresión, pero siento que necesita un apoyo extra.</p></div>

      <div class="body"><p>AN EXOTIC ARCHIPELAGO UNTOUCHED BY HUMAN HANDS</p>
<p>And the quest for meritable Ambient continues. It's a genre I'm perpetually fascinated by, yet rarely impressed with. On the surface, Andrew Pekler's <em>Sounds From Phantom Islands</em> seemed promising. Why? It devoted itself to Ambient's most important facet; concept. Without it, total insignificance tapered around aimless, arbitrary parameters amounting to nothing in particular. Because it so concerns itself with inaccessible island life, <em>Phantom Islands</em> can't be accused of triviality, fully engrossing itself in the topic at hand. Unfortunately, Pekler leaves little to the imagination, doubling down on verity with minimal mystery, reusing countless textural assets over the course of <em>Phantom Islands'</em> ten songs. It's a bore to engage with, and a chore to endure.</p>
<p>In terms of devoting itself to a scenic aesthetic, <em>Phantom Islands</em> has numerous equals. Whether it's The KLF's exceptional <em>Chill Out</em> that toured America's southeast, Lilien Rosarian's <em>A Day In Bel Bruit</em> that recreated a future society rebuilding with only their essentials, or Brian Eno's complete Ambient series (<em>Music For Airports</em>, <em>On Land</em>, <em>Apollo</em>, you name it), there's plenty of comparative points - successful ones, might I add - that equate visual scenery to an inviting musical environment. <em>Phantom Islands</em> isn't one of those, providing almost nonexistent variety or growth, while having the audacity to don each track with a specific island identity, in spite of the objectionable parallelism across the board. In fact, the most notable aspect of Pekler's project is the detailed, history-laden map where one can tour the islands featured (<a href="http://www.andrewpekler.com/phantom-islands/">http://www.andrewpekler.com/phantom-islands/</a>), further cultivating his commitment to the location. Still, in a musical sense, <em>Phantom Islands</em> is devoid of any such satisfaction. No songs standout, nor intend to, apart from potentially 'Description Of Rain' which sounds almost Vaporwave-esque, akin to 2 8 1 4.  </p>
<p>For more interesting, provocative takes on remote island life I'd suggest Brian Eno and David Byrne's collaboration <em>My Life In The Bush Of Ghosts</em>, The Caretaker's side project <em>High Altitude Over Our Little Grass Shack In Kealakekua</em> under the pseudonym Alien Porno Midgets, or even Joe Meek's forward-thinking landmark <em>I Hear A New World</em>, though the later focuses on extraterrestrial life with the same undiscovered panache.</p>

      <div class="body"><p>Collage music like this can always be a hit or a miss since it really depends on what records one is using and how they are putting them together. I myself tend to lean more towards the chaotic and spastic style of epic collage than I do with more atmospheric pieces like this. Lia Kohl pulls from many different radio broadcasts and field recordings to create a soothing and spiritual listening experience. The way they manipulate these recordings shows a lot of unique experimentation. However, several times a track has no substance or just goes nowhere for the time it is on. The back half of the record is a much stronger showing but I just wish the ideas were flushed out more.</p></div>

      <div class="body"><p>Probably my least favorite Erstwhile release so far. I usually like Keith Rowe and Thomas Lehn's music a good bit, so this is a little surprising. I'm not too familiar with Schmickler. Most of this disc seems just like random and annoying bursts of electronic sounds to me, and there's only a few tracks where the music becomes focused and clear. In fact, even though my tastes don't align too closely with Erstwhile in general, I rarely dislike the stuff, occasionally love it, and generally feel reasonably tuned into the aesthetics at play, so I'm really puzzled why this was even released. There's even some extremely annoying snatches of dance pop in the mix, which might come from Rowe's standard radio technique. It's just a recording best forgotten, a typical electronic improv trainwreck session, even though there are a few short moments of the subtle brilliance I expect from musicians of this caliber. It's okay as background music though, except for the occasional really annoying bit or jump in volume.</p></div>

Felizmente, o que ouvimos também conta na apreciação de um disco (ironia...) e esta pequena aventura de 21 minutos não soa nem de perto tão bem como algumas composições que gente como Eimert, Stockhausen ou Dockstader irão criar, 10 anos depois.

      <div class="body"><p>This album comes with the following instruction <em>small sounds are to merge and fuse with your acoustic environment - please play in a transparent level; in different atmosphere</em>.<br />
Although I wholeheartedly agree with this advice, I did decide to put it to a test and try different settings:  </p>
<p>1) Loud/louder then the environment in a pretty barren acoustic environment: turned out to be pretty unpleasant with most if not all songs, justly ill-advised to do this.  </p>
<p>2) With an open window in order to maximise my acoustic environment. I could hear the wind rustling through the wind, two women conversing on the street, school children playing in the distance, lonesome cars passing by nearby &amp; many cars passing by in the distance (sounds a bit like the murmur of the sea doesn’t it, in Dutch we even call that sound like that – we say that you can hear the sea). I found that not only the sounds were a bit too much obscured at the low level that I was playing this but I also found my own acoustic environment to be more enjoyable then this record.  </p>
<p>3) Like the instruction said, barely audible sound level and using my own rather barren aural environment. This one did work the best indeed, it is fun if you cannot always tell whether there is any sounds playing or if you cannot tell which are outside or are coming from the album.  </p>
<p>4) I tried just playing this album or looping some of the tracks. Just playing this album seemed to work best.</p>
<p>The sounds themselves are all indeed pretty quite and minimal and seem to be amplified (likely untreated) but possibly (likely) looped every day sounds. Balloon for instance seem to be simply the sound of a balloon &amp; same for heater etc. There are also some people present here; singing, talking,... "Mong" for instance has singing and is quite fun. It reminded me a bit of the work of Steve Roden or rather the other way around since this is from 1999. This is much simpler and less conceptual then the work of Steve Roden and frankly less interesting. I found not having this playing preferable to having this playing. Miki Yui’s own “Silence Resounding” is similar to this album but superior in my own opinion. It is nice but I have heard better lower case and I didn’t feel that this gave a surplus value to my own sound environment. The second half of the album seemed better then the first one. It works a bit better like a quite record rather then a means of enriching your acoustic environment.</p></div>

      <div class="body"><p>The 11-minute "Anger Alert" begins as a waterfall of high-pitched <a href="https://rateyourmusic.com/genre/noise/" title="[Genre342]">Noise</a> (a more realistic description would be that it sounds like trying to discern shapes out of static-noise in a television), but halfway through it turns to stepping into an unknown habitat, where vibrant echoes distort perceptions. This goes on for a while, but later it redefines itself as a weird theme whose main elements are a short brass riff and slowed-down humming. Huh?  </p>
<p>The 9-minute "Flaws Played Thawed and Flayed" is a <a href="https://rateyourmusic.com/genre/noise/" title="[Genre342]">Noise</a>-<a href="https://rateyourmusic.com/genre/ambient/" title="[Genre84]">Ambient</a> theater performance: abstract doodling with the aim of showcasing a feel of environmental alienation. In a sense this is the noise equivalent of <a href="https://rateyourmusic.com/genre/eai/" title="[Genre21667]">EAI</a>, but does anybody really care?</p>
<p>"Abuse" sounds like the noise that dial-up modems used to make when they would connect to the internet, but at least they needed less time than the three minutes that this track lasts. The harmonic standstill of "Boatswain's Call" (a futile exercise in subtle oscillation) further fails to stimulate your disaffected interest glands, but is that really a surprise? The initial atmospheric hissing of "Outside Now" soon gives way to a choir of vibrating one-note tones, and then to sharp crackling and bass-y ranting, with all the elements coalescing in one big buzz. This is one of the most appealing tracks here, but it's still barely up to par.  </p>
<p>And thus we reach the first behemoth, the 34-minute "The Abyss". It begins with sub-bass nebula-ic gyration, like a spectroscopic rendition of clouds gathering. Eventually this leads to the appearance of weak harmonies and subwoofer-y rumbling, and then to stoic and gentle hovering (kosmische-style). At it's final stages, the cosmic flight hits some turbulence as it reaches the flames of a star, but the track calmly embraces it and dies. Although the title is misleading, this is a decent <a href="https://rateyourmusic.com/genre/drone/" title="[Genre246]">Drone</a>-Kosmische track that has no common characteristics with what preceded it and could constitute a (better) album of it's own.</p>
<p>And finally, we reach the 50-minute colossus "The Echo of Your Past". It starts as an amplified <a href="https://rateyourmusic.com/genre/field-recordings/" title="[Genre293]">Field Recordings</a> episode that is soon drowned by macroscopic whirring. Suddenly we have moved too far, the landscape is empty and an abstract heartbeat is more felt by it's tremors rather than heard. Distant noise appears and then fades as the track approaches a droning dome that sounds like the propeller of a helicopter that then goes supernova and covers everything. This goes on for forever. Abruptly, we are back to the manipulated nature landscape of the beginning, but this quickly disappears in microscopic sub-noise. Again this goes on for forever. It feels as if you've stuck a microphone in a rathole, reduced the tremble and increased the bass as far as it goes. Finally, in the horizon clouds are gathering and take over. For the umpteenth time, Drumm and Lescalleet do their usual trick of magnifying the sound until it becomes abstract, and so all we hear is accidental bass-y roaring. I've nearly fallen asleep when static crackling wakes me up and reminds me that I'm actually listening to a record. Digital percussion imitates the sound of a storm, and then a dim organ line surfaces and beeps like signalling Morse code. As the track ends in yet another reprise of the cricket-y sounds of it's beginning, I thank my stars that this torment is finally over.  </p>
<p>Overlong, swollen, pretentious as hell, using dated techniques, unfocused and random, the only track to salvage out of this mess is "The Abyss".</p></div>

      <div class="body"><p>Few can deny Zappa was a multi-faceted musician, with tastes running the gamut. His pentient for classical music is something that has annoyed many of his rock followers for years, beginning with this release, his very first solo album. Originally recorded in Feb, 1967, Zappa 'conducts' the Abnuceals Emuukha Electric Symphony Orchestra &amp; Chorus. The results are an orchestrated symphonic prog experiment which hits or misses the mark, depending on your own particular tastes. Side 1 is loosely based on the theme from "Oh No, I Don't Believe It", a track ultimately recorded by The Fraternity of Man on their debut, and for which Zappa contributes guitar. The second side is much more free form, with some spoken word passages. Many listeners seem to agree this is not one of his essential albums, and is a mildly historical curiosity at best. Grades (per side) - 1 B-, and a C+.</p></div>

      <div class="body"><p>Throughout his career, Frank Zappa made many high quality albums, this is not one of those albums. Structurally, it is quite an interesting effort, essentially being 2 collages of various musical textures and ideas, the issue being that these range from really fun, interesting surf rock type pieces and interesting, experimental soundscapes, to extended conversations talking about basically nothing, providing a major case of inconsistency. Credit where credit is due, I definitely find some of the concepts here to be really interesting and good, particularly the first 5 or 6 minutes of 'Part 1', which gave me high hopes for the rest, being some fun avant garde goodness, with the strange conversation being quite funny as well. The issue is that the subsequent conversations throughout the album don't have this same kind of charm, and instead stop what little momentum was being built, all before going into another section, often sounding awful and full of random noises, such as some really unappealing snorting.  </p>
<p>I feel that despite the impressive feat of editing this is, the music has such little coherence and such little musicality in many parts, that it just becomes incredibly boring by the second half, since you basically know what you're going to get, more random noises, with the occasional moment of inspiration, before disappearing quickly to move onto another ill conceived idea. And this lack of cohesion and surprising predictability in something so labyrinthine in nature is a large part of the reason why this album just doesn't work, as it definitely needed to be edited, cut and fixed up in multiple places in order to have this work. This is definitely an extremely poor choice for anyone who wants to get into Zappa's discography, and that they should definitely pick basically any other album from this general era of Zappa.</p>
<p>Verdict: An absolute mess with some really great, fun moments spread throughout, but overall don't save the album from ending up being really boring in parts. I'd only recommend this to those who are big fans of the kind of experimentation that takes place here, or for those who are very interested in Zappa's music, otherwise, just don't bother with this.</p>

<p>Lumpy Gravy is a hard listen.

The sound collage aspect is over my head. I liked some of it, but it goes on way long, and the instrumental parts of the album are so good it just feels like wasted space.

But the longer I listen the longer it feels increasingly artificial - no deeper logic for these things to obscure, no reason for any of it, a collection of snippets thrust together in the apparent hope that as a whole they'd form some kind of chemistry by virtue of all having incomprehensible moaning vocals, vaguely similar sound design, and extraneous punctuation in their titles. But this did not happen, and we are left with a list of clues without a murder mystery.</p></div>

      <div class="body"><p>EXPERIENCING AN ONEROUS HANGOVER AT SUNDAY MASS</p>
<p>The high of Carl Stone's previous 2019 record <em>Baroo</em> was unlike anything heard before. The under-appreciated kingpin of Electronica expanded that realm once again, as he did in the early 90's (see: <em>Mom's</em>), pushing sound processing and multi-layering to its absolute limit. <em>Himalaya</em>, his second record of the year, teases that same approach with a different background. Unlike <em>Baroo</em>, which seemed devoted to South American festival traditions, <em>Himalaya</em> took to the diverse cultures of Asia and that feracity can be experienced handedly in 'Han Yan,' 'Bia Bia,' and 'Jame Jam,' the album's first three and best three tracks. Here, Stone finds beauty in the absurdity of tourist overload, constantly reveling in the sights, smells, tastes, and languages of foreign lands. It's a magnificent endorphin rush that easily compares with <em>Baroo</em>.  </p>
<p>Unfortunately, the second half is a slog marked by three tracks exceeding 13 minutes. 'Kikanbou,' the only to resemble the first three tracks in style, clocks in at 17 minutes and parrots Stone's distant past by using advanced looping mechanisms to get from point A to point B. Sort of like Rube Goldberg machine. As for 'Fujiken (Final Section)' and 'Himalaya (with Akaihirume),' there's not much to say as Stone's occasional knack for Minimalism reaches it ultimatum here. The former, devoid of substance and refinement, meanders around for far too long like a monk swaying around a monastery. It offers nothing but empty light Ambient texturing and a slight uncomfortable atmosphere thanks to the groaning vocals. 'Himalaya' fairs better due to Akaihirume's lovely vocals, echoing Bjork at her most extended, but still falters due to sheer lethargy.</p>

      <div class="body"><p>Free improv is probably the most subjective category of music, generally throwing out a ton of novel information that different listeners hear in drastically different ways. The way I generally judge free improv is that there's not much basis for saying something is great, because anything could be great if the listener hears it in a certain way, but it's easy to say something is bad when it's full of cliches that distract the whole experience of engaging in serious listening. Cliches are a bit more objective. They stick out like sore thumbs and have a recognizable structure.  </p>
<p>Unfortunately this first release by Phantom Orchard, the duo of Zeena Parkins and Ikue Mori, is full of really shameless cliches that are the hallmark of free improv conducted as a kind of random sampling of a musician's instrumental habits ("licks"). As with most music I've heard from Mori, she seems to be copying the worst "let's play with this electronic toy" effects of 60s academic electronic music. Parkins rarely uses the inherent sound qualities of her harp, instead relying on your basic aresenal of cheesy electronic effects. Almost everything in this music is a cliche, whether the sounds themselves or the boing-boing phrasing or the random dramatic flourishes. It's the exact opposite of everything I find interesting and enjoyable in free improv. I could easily pick out lots of nice little passages in an album like this, but it's a fool's errand to sift through music like that instead of spending time with the many alternatives made by improvisors who are more focused and consistent, offering an unbroken, focused, spiritually immersive experience of abstract sound.</p>
<p>I hate to be the one to say this, but these two musicians get a lot of attention even when they make shitty music, because they are famous and part of a clique of famous and influential musicians. There are hundreds of obscure, neglected, marginalized improvisors all around the world who are way more advanced in terms of instrumental vocabulary and compositional concepts, but musicians like these get paid a lot of money to travel to festivals and their random improv sessions get released by prestigious labels. These things are driven by scenesterism and marketing and celebrity culture instead of the true artistic experience. I really like some of Zeena Parkins' albums where she's more of a composer and bandleader than an improvisor, and of course she did great work at the service of the saintly Lindsay Cooper in News from Babel. And she's a spiffy improvisor sometimes too, e.g. her duo with Chris Cutler. I'd have to dig deep to find something nice to say about Mori's music though. She's famous for only two reasons. One is that she was in a horrible joke-punk band in the late 70s, DNA, who remain popular and influential despite their lack of talent and inspiration, and despite the existence of groups from the same scene and era who made amazing music, because people are attracted to them as concept art. The other reason is that she's been one of John Zorn's closest friends since the early 80s and helps to run the influential, saintly Tzadik label. Unfortunately her computer music usually sounds like random button-pressing to me.</p></div>

      <div class="body"><p><strong>8 Electronic Pieces</strong> is the first true outsider musique concréte work. While Halim Al-Dabh accidentally made musique concréte without ever hearing it, Tod Dockstader had heard Schaeffer's work and was essentially imitating it and reacting to it. The results were very unique, a collection of pieces that can't accurately be described as musique concréte in their sensibilities but still adhere to much of the movement's aesthetic.  </p>
<p>Dockstader's pieces are all cohesive despite being semi-randomly composed. He made sure that any sound he included fit its piece properly, unlike many other musique concréte composers who seemed more than happy to include something unfitting if it was novel enough. The downside to this is that it lead to there being a striking lack of variation on this album. Doppler effects, whirling rotors and dark ambiance dominate many of these tracks and while the latter is generally used to good effect, the whirls in particular get very tiring. Almost every piece features something that sounds like a plane taking off, and sometimes this sound is looped two or three times in a row.  </p>
<p>The best works are without exception the longest. Many of the short works cram too many ideas in at once, and the result is cartoony rather than the intended chaos. <strong>Pieces #7 and #8</strong> are the best realizations of Dockstader's vision - they are coherent, interesting and spacious. Sounds are presented with more dignity and can be properly explored by the listener.</p>
<p>Although I don't think it is particularly representative of Dockstader's goals, I found <strong>Piece #5</strong> to be the most enjoyable. It's a piece with a sense of emptiness to it - there are only a couple of the rotary sounds and few collisions, a lot of the track is vast and evocative atmospheres. It is an intriguing outlier and proof that Dockstader does in fact know how to make music for a listener.  </p>
<p>In general, Eight Electronic Pieces is weak. The first few compositions are little more than Dockstader figuring out his method, and it really isn't compelling listening. There are moments of genius, but they're hidden amongst motifs overused to the point of banality and failed experimentation. Dockstader's album is original and interesting, it just isn't very good.</p></div>

<p>“Field rituals” è un disco di cui si potrebbe fare a meno ma ciò non significa che il nuovo lavoro di Koen Holtkamp sia negativo.<br />
“Field rituals” pecca di smisurato minimalismo e consequenziale ripetitività che, magari, affrontando un discorso filosofico deleuziano, potrebbe essere un punto a suo favore ma, purtroppo, in quest’occasione, cioè nell’ambito di una recensione musicale, è un grosso difetto.<br />
L’eccessiva durata dell’album non è sinonimo di eccessiva creatività ma di ripetizione di suoni, rumori e atmosfere che potrebbero benissimo essere lo sfondo sonoro di un film. La proposta musicale è valida, ci sono pezzi pulsanti e magnetici come “You mean the world to me”, un ambient-drone interessante che, con “Night swimmer”, è il momento migliore dell’album.<br />
Koen Holtkamp ha solo due lavori all’attivo ed è il vero deus ex machina del progetto. Oltre ad occuparsi della parte elettronica, suona la chitarra a sei e a dodici corde, l’armonica ed è anche voce-strumento in “Night swimmer”.<br />
“Field rituals” è un album glaciale che si dipana verso orizzonti mistici e impercettibili regalando segnali di tenebre partoriti direttamente dalla coscienza.<br />
Ha la freddezza del sangue rappreso e offre sonorità extra-sensoriali, astrali, che immergono l’ascoltatore in un giaciglio radioattivo e fluorescente come nel caso dell’ultima traccia “Haus und spirale im regen”.<br />
Sicuramente “Field rituals”, anche grazie all’uso eccessivo di delay, non è il classico album ambient-new age che mette tranquillità ma, al contrario, pone l’ascoltatore in uno stato d’agitazione grazie ad una struttura sonora che punta sull’enfasi e su arrangiamenti emozionali.<br />
In definitiva, il nuovo lavoro di Koen Holtkamp è un lungo trip, non immediato, di un’ora che evoca immagini e sensazioni psichedeliche, vibranti e celestiali, che non consentono all’ascoltatore una via di fuga.</p></div>

<p>The electronic mass-collaboration, when will I learn? Don’t listen to it, ok? Don’t!<br />
I don’t know, often when electronic beasts come together to create something in a group it always comes off as half finished. You can here traces of good but as a whole it doesn’t work. To many sources of creativity I think. But I love the electronic duo work. For instance, <a href="https://rateyourmusic.com/artist/taylor-deupree" title="[Artist51594]">Taylor Deupree</a> creates some of his best work with other people; I’m thinking mainly on his collabs with <a href="https://rateyourmusic.com/artist/taylor_deupree___kenneth_kirschner" title="[Artist87140]">Kenneth Kirschner</a>, <a href="https://rateyourmusic.com/artist/ashley-cleveland" title="[Artist5404]">Christopher Willits</a> and .... On those you get two minds coming in to the work with two different mind sets, and the result is perfect. It two styles melting together as one, they are not pasted over each other. Last year’s collaboration between ... also comes to mind, or the perfect <a href="https://rateyourmusic.com/release/album/aix-em-klemm/aix-em-klemm/" title="[Album34647]">Aix Em Klemm</a> record. And the two records ... done together. The list could go on for awhile.<br />
Here on the other hand you’ve got five different minds in charge to make a record. And the result becomes kind of boring. The five people are all masters in their field and good musicians and producers, for example <a href="https://rateyourmusic.com/artist/fennesz" title="[Artist4780]">Fennesz</a> and <a href="https://rateyourmusic.com/artist/pimmon" title="[Artist50141]">Pimmon</a> do wonderful work on their own, but that doesn’t help. Goddam! Stop listening to it Thomas. Stop! STOP!<br />
Or perhaps it’s not the five minds on one record that’s the issue, maybe it’s whenever Peter Rehnberg, also known as <a href="https://rateyourmusic.com/artist/pita" title="[Artist31203]">Pita</a>, is a member that my allergies is acting up on me. Maybe. Perhaps.</p></div>

      <div class="body"><p>The interesting thing about EAI and general "electroacoustic" music is how many records of it end up sounding somewhat similar to each other, despite the genre label covering theoretically one of the broadest fields of music possible. I mean this less as criticism and more as an observation that is immediately applicable to this record as well. Split into two halves: the four Dances initially consist majorly of densely layered, heavily modulated vocal samples, sped up/stretched and bouncing from channel to channel, achieving a busy effect evocative of either <a href="https://rateyourmusic.com/release/album/elektronisches-studio-des-wdr-koln-karlheinz-stockhausen/gesang-der-junglinge-kontakte/" title="[Album184832]">Gesang der Jünglinge; Kontakte</a> or a swarm of wasps chatting with each other, though Dances IV is mellower and approaches ambient territory at spots. Themes is largely more of the same, though the noises are mostly more high-pitched and have an odd squeaky character at times. It's complex and constantly shifting, while not really heading anywhere, and there's little here that sticks to ear unfortunately.</p></div>

The tracks definitely run -way- too long and there's not much of interest here except for the ominous ambiance, though the last track keeps it at a reasonable length, emphasizes the sound collage elements and therefore manages to be the strongest out of the bunch by a large margin. A nice diversion for the usual Merzbow listener, unfortunately also quite a boring one.</p></div>

If you are willing to forfeit your sanity for half an hour, you will be subjected to the best-ever record to get rid of your guests when you're feeling a little knackered, even if they happen to be Merzbow fans. So I'll give it two stars for social usefulness, only about a half of which is actually related to any musical enjoyment to be derived from its consumption.</p></div>

      <div class="body"><p>Perception <a href="2.5">Glitch</a></p>
<p>I mentioned how Schwarze Riesenfalter felt very natural and human. I feel that a lot of electronic music lose that kind of<br />
emotion when the artistic value is processed through a computer. I don't think it's always the case, but I do find that it's<br />
something that often happens in electronic music and I think it's both a shame and a failure for the artist to not be able<br />
to communicate a certain emotion through their creation. This is what happens with Ahnnu's Percussions. It's a record that<br />
seems to repeat itself over and over again, never challenging itself or its listener and just setting into a comfortable<br />
groove that became uninteresting and trite about 10 minutes into the record. Halfway through I'm done with Percussions and<br />
feel inclined to never return. Compared to a record like D/P/I's MN.ROY from last year you quickly notice how void of emotion<br />
Percussions is. It's an album created not because it should have been, but because it could have been. And I'm not calling it<br />
some kind of musical abomination that should never have been made, it's probably an okay album if you're a hardcore fan of the<br />
genre, but I can't help but question if it really needed to be created, if it fills any kind of artistical purpose, or if<br />
Ahnnu just thought, "hey, this would be neat!" and didn't stop to think about why it should exist.<br />
Maybe I'm overreacting here but I found Percussions to be truly a horrible example of how electronic music should be made and<br />
how it should sound. It's an awful attempt at making something memorable and an album I wouldn't recommend to anyone.</p></div>

      <div class="body"><p>While both Can, John Cale, Faust and Terry Riley bridged the gap between rock music and serious electronic avant garde music ala Karlheinz Stockhausen, the collaboration between Pierre Henry and Spooky Tooth on <em>Ceremony</em> only widened it. Originally conceived as a Pierre Henry project he commissioned Spooky Tooth as his backing band. With groups such as the Velvet Underground, Can, Faust, Kraftwerk or anybody else in avant garde rock, why Henry picked a blues rock band is beyond me. Some people will defend this album as being ahead of it's time, though realistically Henry's contributions were not all that different from his early electronic work with Pierre Schaffer in the early 1950's. The only group I could see being influenced by this mess is maybe Spinal Tap and I am sure if the album <em>The Gospel According To Spinal Tap</em> had actually existed, it would have been better than this. Pick up Lou Reed's <em>Metal Machine Music</em> instead.</p></div>

<p>I'll leave the whole matter of the lyrics aside. I'm just as indifferent to gospel-preaching lyricism as I am to Satan-worshipping stuff.  </p>
<p>Sticking to the music, what you have here is actually a good, perhaps very good or even great, moody hard rock album, which is rendered almost unlistenable by the layers of experimental sounds thrown upon it. Much more than a problem of mismatching experimentations, it's a matter of downright awful mixing. If things were better mixed, a good deal of Pierre Harry's contributions would still be no better than utterly dispensable, but, as things are, they actually force everything the band does right to die on the background. Because if you want to listen to the hard rock contained here at the volume distorted guitars require, Harry's noises will destroy your ears. Especially if you're listening to this on headphones.  </p>
<p>And, in truth, the injurious mixing isn't limited to the noise layers, since the vocals can also get so awfully loud in the mix, they too can cause you some pain.  </p>
<p>For a religious-themed record, this seems like a deliberate effort at sacrilege.  </p>

      <div class="body"><p>I've never been so annoyed with a good album. If you listen to the music alone, this is by far Spooky Tooth's best album. That guitar is damn heavy and the solos kick the shit out of any other heavy psyche album.<br />
But there are two huge factors that conspire to make this album unlistenable. First of all, there's the horrible christian lyrics. I thought I'd be able to stomach it, especially since I am a huge fan of Fraction's Moon Blood. But this is much more overtly christian than I expected. I thought maybe I'd ignore the words since I can't seem to notice the lyrics from every other album I've listened to. But these lyrics force your attention and give you the impression that you're actually sitting in a church and worshipping right along with the zealous preacher. Ugh. It's hard to imagine this if you take into account that the atmosphere of the music is so dark and evil that it seems like the vocalist should be worshipping Satan. But this irony is still not enough to overcome the overwhelmingly christian message.<br />
The second thing that really makes this album bad is the stupid sound effects. Whether it's some loud, atonal keyboard noise that plays the same thing over and over until the end of the song, or some stupid vocalisation that's utilised in the same exact way, it's painfully obvious that the extra sounds are unnecessary and counter-productive to the artistic nature of the music. Take those two horrible aspects out of this album and the rating jumps to 4.5, hell, maybe even 5.0!</p></div>

      <div class="body"><p>This album contains a nice mix of modern classical, ambiance, and even some jazz aspects. However, it doesn’t seem to blend these well enough to make something worthwhile and unique.<br />
I enjoy the tense atmosphere of this album at times, but it doesn’t feel very cohesive. The spoken word parts come off a little goofy and disjointed, and don’t blend well with the atmosphere.<br />
The music contains momentary glimpses of brilliance but feels lacklustre overall; it’s pretty sad when the highlight of a whole piece is an interesting bass fill every 4 bars.<br />
Still, good musicianship and willingness to implement new ideas saves this from being too far below average. I will not listen to this again or recommend it, though.</p></div>

In this way <em>Plat du Jour</em> is similar to other albums with this approach; he took every sample from something to do with eating or drinking, quite how Matmos took all of <em>Cut/Cure</em> from surgeries. And it's a fascinating approach! But the truly best of his work, to me, was with Bjork, someone who could channel his experiments into a structured form that was less heady, more emotional, and just an absolute delight to listen to. On its own, it's interesting, for sure, but not one of my favorite albums.</p></div>

If you have never heard of the electronic production trio, their gimmick is they tie one hand behind their back with every release. The hindrance they put on themselves with this new album is they use only samples from a research-based recording studio whose research was on recording all-natural samples. From animals and insects to human bodily sounds. “Return to Archive” has a focused idea in which the groups focus on rhythmic techno-inspired progressions with these very abstract samples. However, I wish the group would have gone for a more ambient or sound college idea than trying to create these abstract rhythms and grooves from the samples. I just have a hard time sitting through this without being bored. Every track kind of feels the same as the last. The only difference is on the 13-minute title track in which they do exactly that. A more sound collage and ambient that progressed nicely from one sample to the next.</p></div>

      <div class="body"><p>Nothing incredible, but it is better than I was expecting (except for the drums -- they just sound cheap and really terrible). In fact, on its own, the first disc was even pretty nice. Markus Popp still has a way of getting fractured, pretty melodies out of whatever sounds he's using. However, the sonic palette for the whole album is incredibly similar, and it all starts to blend together after 15-20 tracks -- there are 76 total. Clocking in at over two hours, it's simply way, way, way too long for what comparatively little it has to say. Popp needs to take a lesson in "less is more" from <a href="https://rateyourmusic.com/release/album/microstoria/init-ding/" title="[Album122278]">his</a> <a href="https://rateyourmusic.com/release/album/microstoria/_snd/" title="[Album40467]">earlier</a> <a href="https://rateyourmusic.com/release/album/microstoria/model-3-step-2/" title="[Album122281]">work</a>.</p></div>

      <div class="meta">Release: Rian Treanor & Ocen James - Saccades | Year: 2023 | Vote: 2.5</div>
      <div class="body"><p>Few months ago Boomkat enthusiastically announced this collaboration between <a href="https://rateyourmusic.com/artist/mark-fell" title="[Artist106200]">Mark Fell</a>'s son Rian Treanor and Ugandan musician Ocen James. James plays <em>rigi rigi</em>, a one string bowed instrument whose main perceptual attributes seem to be its unstable intonation and its rather peculiar materiality. Treanor has certainly prepared for this collaboration, trying to make his trademark percussive synths match with a vaguely Ugandan style. However, the result seem to be rather approximative, overly under-developed, and directionless.  </p>
<p>In the first two tracks, James plays only inharmonic gestures made by emphasizing the friction of the bow in a way that resembles some contemporary extended techniques in Western strings; though it is a potentially interesting sound, it is microphoned very closely and that produces a very strange effect, so that the rest of the music, whose spatial attributes are completely different, seems rather detached. In these instances, the friction-based playing seem to be used as a mere effect, without that action producing any further musical significance. That's unfortunate, because it's in those first two tracks that the electronic part is most interesting, both in pattern articulation and in sound design. After that, James start to play his instrument as intended; that is, by obsessively repeating a small melodic cell. Those tracks are abysmally static, they are frozen moments being reiterated way too much without any real development.</p>
<p>I understand that this music is not supposed to follow precise formal principles and it is fine with just circling around an idea, but in this case it seems very much a wasted opportunity, because Treanor's stunning rhythmic programming would have been an astounding element if properly blended with Acholi folklore. Instead, the two sounds don't match at all, partly because the intrinsic possibilities of the rigi rigi seem quite limited, partly because there is no clear compositional thinking over the arrangement of the tracks.</p></div>

      <div class="body"><p>The theme song compilation for internet creepypastas</p>
<p>No Era Sólida is a strange entity. It is a minimalistic post-industrial piece that is all but lively. It's often out of tune and hardly even musical. It can range from warped voices as though they're speaking into a fan to an eerie series of ringing which reminds me of an emergency broadcast alarm to echoed and repetitive percussion. It's less of a fully formed album and more of an art project of strange tape recordings meant to replicate living oddities. I can't say it's a phenomenal album but it is certainly interesting.</p></div>

      <div class="body"><p>Как, значит, пишет альбомы Орен Амбэрчи.  </p>
<p>Включает микрофон, идет заварить чайку. Возвращается, щелкает чем-то. Включает проигрыватель, но пластинки не ставит. Какие пластинки, Орен же пишет альбом! Ходит по комнате, щелкает чем-то и думает, чего бы сыграть. На 10 минуте приходит в голову, что ой как хорошо бы потренькать на гитарке. Берет гитарку, подходит к микрофону - тренькает. Через несколько минут все надоедает, и он идет еще заварить чайку (видимо, очень любит чаек наш Орен). Сам того не замечая, случайно толкает микрофон к колонке и тот начинает жутко фонить. Орен делает себе чаек, а микрофон-то фонит! Потом он возвращается, ужасается, и возвращает микрофон на место.  </p>
<p>Попив чайку, снова его одолевают мысли, и опять начинаются шатания по комнате с пощелкиваниями. В эти моменты Орен думает, как хорошо было бы записать клевый альбом! И чтобы музыка прям ваще, и чтобы дыжь-дыжь гитары, и дум-дум-дум бас. Через 10 минут Оре замечает, что, оказывается, идет запись. АААА!!!  </p>
<p>Ну а куда деваться-то. Что-то записано -- издаем. Пипл хавает и параллельно кончает от страшного авангардизма и интереснейших "музыкальных соцветий". Ура.</p></div>
